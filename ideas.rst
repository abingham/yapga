Things to investigate
=====================

 - # revisions vs. initial change size
 - histogram of revision count
 - # reviewers vs. # of comments
 - defect density: # comments vs. # lines of change

Per-user analysis
-----------------

  - avg. comments / review
  - ^^^, but normalized for change size

Language analysis
-----------------

 - comments per line for a language
 - change size per language
